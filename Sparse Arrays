This challenge is a collection of input strings and a collection of query strings. For each query string, determine how many times it occurs in the list of 
input strings. Return an array of the results.
Sounds a little bit confusing isn't it? :confused:
I will deploy the idea from counting sort but I return the counted array instead.
